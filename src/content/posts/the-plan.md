I have ~37 months left to finish my degree. By then, i want to have a job offer lined up at one of my dream companies (meaning work i'm interested in with good pay), whether remote or hybrid.

In the meantime i can't just wait around or stay at home and study until magically i have what it takes to land a big offer. I need to improve on my skills, working at the edge of my abilities and constantly increasing my knowledge.

For that i came up with this plan. (Subject to adjustment)

- Step 1: Work at a local company earning good money. $
- Step 2: Work at a local company in a fullstack / backend engineering position. $$
- Step 3: Study AI, infra and algorithms.
- Step 4: Build projects that reach users. Build a personal brand on X
- Step 5: Work at a dream company. $$$
